# Incident Documentation
<h1>Description</h1>

In the context of this activity, I will engage in a comprehensive process involving a thorough examination of the particulars surrounding a security incident. My primary objective will be to meticulously document all relevant aspects of the incident using an incident handler's journal. As I delve into this task, it's important to reflect on the significance of documentation, which I have previously explored during my journey to understand the intricacies of the incident response process.

Through my studies, I have come to appreciate the pivotal role played by an incident handler's journal, as it serves as a meticulously organized repository for recording vital information related to security incidents as they unfold and are effectively managed. This practice not only contributes to maintaining a clear and comprehensive record but also facilitates the continuous improvement of incident response procedures and the broader field of cybersecurity.


<h2>Scenario</h2>

Review the scenario below.

A small U.S. health care clinic specializing in delivering primary-care services experienced a security incident on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. Several employees reported that they were unable to use their computers to access files like medical records. Business operations shut down because employees were unable to access the files and software needed to do their job.

Additionally, employees also reported that a ransom note was displayed on their computers. The ransom note stated that all the company's files were encrypted by an organized group of unethical hackers who are known to target organizations in healthcare and transportation industries. In exchange for restoring access to the encrypted files, the ransom note demanded a large sum of money in exchange for the decryption key. 

The attackers were able to gain access to the company's network by using targeted phishing emails, which were sent to several employees of the company. The phishing emails contained a malicious attachment that installed malware on the employee's computer once it was downloaded.

Once the attackers gained access, they deployed their ransomware, which encrypted critical files. The company was unable to access critical patient data, causing major disruptions in their business operations. The company was forced to shut down their computer systems and contact several organizations to report the incident and receive technical assistance.

<h3> Capture the 5 W's of an incident </h3>

  - Who: The incident was caused by an organized group of unethical hackers
  - What: A ransomware security incident 
  - When: The incident occurred on Tuesday morning, at approximately 9:00 a.m.
  - Where: The incident happened at a health care company
  - Why: The incident occurred due to the infiltration of the company's systems by unethical hackers through a phishing attack.

The attackers seem to be primarily driven by financial motives, as evidenced by the ransom note they issued, which demanded a substantial sum of money in exchange for the decryption key.


<h3> Additional notes </h3>

 - How could the health care company prevent an incident like this from occurring again?
 - Should the company pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key?
