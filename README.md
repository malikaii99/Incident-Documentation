# Incident Documentation
<h1>Description</h1>

In the context of this activity, I will engage in a comprehensive process involving a thorough examination of the particulars surrounding a security incident. My primary objective will be to meticulously document all relevant aspects of the incident using an incident handler's journal. As I delve into this task, it's important to reflect on the significance of documentation, which I have previously explored during my journey to understand the intricacies of the incident response process.

Through my studies, I have come to appreciate the pivotal role played by an incident handler's journal, as it serves as a meticulously organized repository for recording vital information related to security incidents as they unfold and are effectively managed. This practice not only contributes to maintaining a clear and comprehensive record but also facilitates the continuous improvement of incident response procedures and the broader field of cybersecurity.


<h2>Scenario</h2>

Review the scenario below.

You’re part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes.

You are performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework. You will go through each of the seven stages of the framework to identify security requirements for the new Sneaker Company app.

First, review the following description of why the sneaker company decided to develop this new app:
Description: Our application should seamlessly connect sellers and shoppers. It should be easy for users to sign-up, log in, and manage their accounts. Data privacy is a big concern for us. We want users to feel confident that we’re being responsible with their information.
Buyers should be able to directly message sellers with questions. They should also have the ability to rate sellers to encourage good service. Sales should be clear and quick to process. Users should have several payment options for a smooth checkout process. Proper payment handling is really important because we want to avoid legal issues.

Next, the application development team is involved with the application because they have the most knowledge about the code base and application logic. Your responsibility as a security professional would be to evaluate the application's architecture for security risks.
